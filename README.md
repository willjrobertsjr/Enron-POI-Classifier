# Enron Scandal POI Classifier

The study builds an algorithm that identifies which Enron employees may have committed fraud leading to the companyâ€™s collapse in 2002.  

In this project, that prediction is whether an employee was a person of interest (POI) in the Enron scandal, and the features were financial data and email records.  There are 14 financial features ranging from salaries and bonuses to various stock options, and the 6 email features include both emails sent and received and whether persons of interest were on the other end of the messages.
